## Extensions

In short: *anything*.

It is important to keep in mind that some systems, such as Silica, sometimes treat folders as single files. This is
determined by the MIME. As such, as long as the MIME is `application/directory` the extension can theoretically be
anything. However, avoid using existing extensions (i.e. `.nfp`) to avoid confusion by users and system.
