## Technical details

The file contains a row of one character long values as pixel information. Each pixel of one row is put directly behind
another in the corresponding line one of these values.

```
0f0f0f0f
0000000f
00000000
  9abc  
12345678
```

This is an example of an image file being opened with a text editor. Each value maches one pixel. The values always have
to be one of the 16 color codes (0-9, a-f).  Having a space as a pixel information makes that pixel transparent.
