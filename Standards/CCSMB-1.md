# CCSMB-1: Procedures for submitting a standard

This RFC defines the protocol for defining and submitting a standard to the CCSMB.

## File names and formatting

Each RFC should be named `CCSMB-n.md`, where `n` is a number counting upwards.

Each RFC should be a [GitHub-Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) document with American English spelling.

## Submission

Each submission should be in the form of a GitHub pull request. To be accepted as a standard, said pull request should have three document reviews and should be merged after that threshold has been met.
